## üéØ Architecture Highlights

### Smart Auth Flow
1. User enters email
2. App checks if email exists (no password shown yet)
3. If exists: Show password field for login
4. If new: Show password + name fields for registration
5. Social auth (Apple/Google) bypasses email check

### Auto-Save System
- Every lesson interaction saved to backend
- User can close app and resume exactly where they left off
- Progress includes: completed sections, exercise answers, time spent

### XP League System
- Weekly competitions (Monday-Sunday)
- Users ranked by XP earned that week
- Tiers based on historical performance
- Promotes engagement through gamification

### Music-Based Learning
- Learn through songs in target language
- Tap lyrics for instant translations
- Difficulty rating per track
- Curated playlists by proficiency level

## üîê Security Notes

- JWT tokens stored in Keychain (secure)
- Google Client ID is public (OAuth requires it)
- Apple Sign In uses cryptographic user IDs
- Backend must validate all OAuth tokens server-side
- Never trust client-side level/XP data - always verify on backend
