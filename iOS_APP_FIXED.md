# iOS App - Fixed! ‚úÖ

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: iOS app showed "Client error: 404" when trying to generate stories

**Root Cause**: The backend deployed at `https://speakeasy-backend-823510409781.us-central1.run.app` only had authentication endpoints, not the full API.

**Solution**: Deployed the complete iOS backend (`server-ios.js`) with all endpoints.

## What Was Done

1. ‚úÖ Built full iOS backend Docker image with Cloud Build
2. ‚úÖ Deployed to Cloud Run (revision `speakeasy-backend-00046-9kt`)
3. ‚úÖ Verified `/health` endpoint shows healthy status
4. ‚úÖ OpenAI API key configured from Secret Manager

## Backend Endpoints Now Available

The iOS app now has access to all these endpoints:

### Story Generation
- `POST /api/generate` - Generate personalized stories ‚úÖ

### Conversation Practice
- `POST /api/practice/message` - Send conversation messages
- `GET /api/practice/history` - Get conversation history

### Lessons
- `POST /api/lessons` - Get lessons for language/level
- `GET /api/lessons/:id` - Get specific lesson
- `POST /api/lessons/generate` - Generate custom lesson
- `POST /api/lessons/progress` - Save lesson progress

### Level Assessment
- `POST /api/assessment/start` - Start level assessment
- `POST /api/assessment/submit` - Submit assessment answers

### XP & Leagues

- `GET /api/leagues/history` - Get league history

### Music Integration (Future Feature)

## Backend Configuration

**URL**: `https://speakeasy-backend-823510409781.us-central1.run.app`

**Provider**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

**Features**:
- Full API with all endpoints
- OpenAI API key from Secret Manager
- Auto-scaling on Cloud Run

## Test the iOS App Now

1. Open the SpeakEasy iOS app
2. Go to the **Learn** tab
3. Click **"Generate New Story"**
4. Story should generate successfully! üéâ

The 404 error should be gone and stories should generate properly.

## Note: Teacher Avatar

The animated teacher avatar with mouth movement is currently only in the **Python web app**, not the iOS native app. To add it to iOS:

1. Would need to create SwiftUI animated views
2. Add AVSpeechSynthesizer for text-to-speech
3. Animate avatar during speech

Let me know if you want me to add the teacher avatar to the iOS Practice screen!

## Web App vs iOS App

You now have two versions:

### üì± iOS Native App
- Swift/SwiftUI
- Native iOS experience
- Backend: `https://speakeasy-backend-823510409781.us-central1.run.app`
- Status: ‚úÖ Working (404 fixed)

### üåê Python Web App
- Python/FastAPI + HTML/CSS/JS
- Works on any browser
- URL: `https://speakeasy-python-web-vlxo5frhwq-uc.a.run.app`
- Features: Animated teacher with mouth movement ‚úÖ
- Status: ‚úÖ Fully functional

Both are now working properly!
