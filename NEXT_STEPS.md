### 📊 Current State

```
Models:           ✅ 100% Complete
API Endpoints:    ✅ 100% Complete
Auth UI:          ✅ 95% Complete (needs 5min SPM setup)
Backend:          ⏳ 0% (ready for implementation)
Feature UIs:      ⏳ 0% (architecture ready)
```

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Complete SPM Setup in Xcode (5-10 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/scott/dev/speakeasy/SpeakEasy
open SpeakEasy.xcodeproj
```

Then follow [SPM_SETUP_GUIDE.md](SpeakEasy/SPM_SETUP_GUIDE.md):

1. Add GoogleSignIn package via SPM
2. Add "Sign in with Apple" capability
3. Configure Google URL scheme
4. Uncomment Google Sign-In code
5. Build and deploy to iPhone

**Result:** Fully working app with email + Apple + Google authentication

### Step 2: Verify App Works (5 minutes)

1. Test email/password registration
2. Test email/password login
3. Test Apple Sign In
4. Test Google Sign In
5. Verify app icon appears on home screen

### Step 3: Backend Implementation (Variable Time)

See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](SpeakEasy/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) for full backend requirements.

**Priority Endpoints:**
- `/api/auth/check-email` - Email existence check
- `/api/auth/register` - Enhanced with username generation
- `/api/auth/apple` - Apple Sign In
- `/api/auth/google` - Google Sign In
