# Configure Web OAuth Client - Next Steps

## You Found It! ✅

Your screenshot shows the correct OAuth client:

**Name:** Web client (auto created by Google Service)
**Type:** Web application
**Client ID:** 823510409781-7am9...
**Created:** Oct 30, 2025

## Next Steps:

1. **Click on the name** "Web client (auto created by Google Service)"

2. **You'll see a configuration page with:**
   - Client ID
   - Client secret
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins** ← This is what you need!
   - **Authorized redirect URIs**

3. **Under "Authorized JavaScript origins", click "+ ADD URI"**

4. **Add this URL:**
   ```
   https://speakeasy-python-web-vlxo5frhwq-uc.a.run.app
   ```

5. **Click "SAVE"** at the bottom

6. **Wait 5 minutes** for changes to propagate

7. **Test your web app** - The Google Sign-In should work now!

## What About the API Key?

The API key you found (`823510409781-7am96n366leset271qt9c8djo265u24n`) is different from the OAuth client. The web app code is looking for an OAuth client, not an API key.

The correct OAuth client is the "Web client (auto created by Google Service)" that you just found in the OAuth 2.0 Client IDs section.
