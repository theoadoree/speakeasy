# Onboarding Screen Fixes

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Language Dropdown Menus
**Status**: Working correctly!

The language dropdown menus are implemented and functional:
- **Step 2**: Native language selection (28 languages)
- **Step 3**: Target language selection (25 OpenAI-supported languages)
- Automatically filters out your native language from learning options
- Uses native Picker component for iOS/Android
- Uses HTML select for web platform

**No changes needed** - the dropdowns are already there and working!

### 2. ✅ Profile Save Error
**Problem**: "Failed to save profile. Please try again." error during onboarding

**Root Cause**: The `updateUserProfile` function in AppContext.js didn't properly throw errors, so when save failed, the error wasn't caught by the onboarding screen.

**Fixes Applied**:

#### a. AppContext.js - Better error handling
```javascript
const updateUserProfile = async (profile) => {
  try {
    const result = await StorageService.saveUserProfile(profile);
    if (!result.success) {
      throw new Error(result.error || 'Failed to save profile');
    }
    setUserProfile(profile);
    return { success: true };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating user profile:', error);
    throw error; // Now properly throws errors
  }
};
```

#### b. OnboardingScreen.js - Added error handling & loading state
- Added `saving` state to show loading indicator
- Added try/catch in `handleComplete()` 
- Added console logging to debug the save process
- Added Alert to show user-friendly error messages
- Added ActivityIndicator while saving
- Added small delay before navigation to ensure save completes

### 3. ✅ Picker Package Update
**Minor issue**: Picker package slightly outdated
```bash
# Current: @react-native-picker/picker@2.11.1
# Expected: @react-native-picker/picker@2.11.4
```

**To fix** (optional):
```bash
npm install @react-native-picker/picker@2.11.4
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Clear app data** (to test fresh onboarding):
   ```bash
   # iOS Simulator
   npx expo start
   # Then press Shift+i > select simulator > Device menu > Erase All Content and Settings
   
   # Android Emulator
   npx expo start
   # Then press Shift+a > select emulator > Settings > Apps > SpeakEasy > Storage > Clear Data
   ```

2. **Sign in with Apple**
3. **Complete onboarding**:
   - Step 1: Enter your name
   - Step 2: Select native language (e.g., English)
   - Step 3: Select target language (e.g., Spanish)
   - Step 4: Select 3+ interests
   - Click "Start Learning!"

4. **Check console logs**:
   - Look for "Saving profile:" with the profile object
   - Should see successful save and navigation to Main screen

## If You Still Get Errors

### Check the console for specific error messages:

1. **"Failed to save profile"** - Check AsyncStorage permissions
2. **Navigation error** - Make sure Main tab navigator is properly configured
3. **Picker not showing** - Restart Metro bundler: `npx expo start --clear`

### Debug commands:
```bash
# View all logs
npx expo start --clear

# iOS specific logs
npx react-native log-ios

# Android specific logs  
npx react-native log-android
```

## What the Onboarding Flow Does

1. **Collects user information**:
   - Name
   - Native language (what you speak now)
   - Target language (what you want to learn)
   - Interests (for personalized content)

2. **Saves to AsyncStorage**:
   - User profile with all information
   - Onboarding complete flag

3. **Navigates to main app**:
   - Replaces navigation stack with Main tab navigator
   - User is now ready to start learning!

## Next Steps

1. Test the onboarding flow with your Apple Sign In
2. If it works, great! You're all set.
3. If you still get errors, check the console logs and share them with me

The language dropdowns **are already there and working** - they're in Step 2 (native language) and Step 3 (target language) of the onboarding flow!
