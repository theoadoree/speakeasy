# Next Steps: Debugging Authentication with Simple Backend

## What I'm Deploying Right Now

I've created a **debug backend** (`server-simple-auth.js`) that:

### Key Features:
1. **No Token Verification** - Accepts any data without validating OAuth tokens
2. **Verbose Logging** - Logs EVERYTHING it receives:
   - Full request body
   - All headers
   - Every field sent by the app
3. **Always Succeeds** - Returns success + valid token no matter what
4. **Shows Exact Data** - Will reveal what the iOS app is actually sending

## Why This Approach?

We've been getting 400 errors for hours. This could be because:
- iOS app sends wrong field names
- Data format doesn't match
- Required fields are missing
- Token encoding issues
- Headers are wrong

The simple backend will show us **exactly** what's happening.

## Once Deployed (ETA: ~5 minutes)

### Step 1: Test iOS App
1. Open SpeakEasy app on your iPhone
2. Tap "Sign in with Apple" - it will show spinner then...
   - ‚úÖ Should work and navigate to next screen!
   - Or ‚ùå Will show error message

3. Tap "Continue with Google" - same thing

### Step 2: Check What Was Sent
```bash
gcloud run services logs read speakeasy-backend \
  --region us-central1 \
  --limit 50 \
  --format="value(textPayload)" | grep -A 20 "APPLE AUTH\|GOOGLE AUTH"
```

This will show output like:
```
üçé === APPLE AUTH REQUEST ===
Full request body: {
  "idToken": "eyJhbGc...",
  "user": "001234.56789...",
  "email": "user@icloud.com",
  ... etc
}
```

### Step 3: Compare to Backend Expectations

I'll compare what the iOS app sent vs what the production backend expects, and fix any mismatches.

### Step 4: Fix & Redeploy

Once we know the exact issue, I'll:
1. Fix the iOS app data format (if needed)
2. Or fix the backend expectations (if needed)
3. Rebuild iOS app
4. Switch back to production backend
5. Test again - should work!

## Build Status

Current command running:
```bash
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/modular-analog-476221-h8/speakeasy-backend backend/
```

Build ID: Check logs at https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds

Once build completes, I'll run:
```bash
gcloud run deploy speakeasy-backend \
  --image gcr.io/modular-analog-476221-h8/speakeasy-backend \
  --region us-central1 \
  --platform managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

## Why This Will Work

Instead of guessing what's wrong, we're going to **see exactly** what's being sent. This is like adding a print statement at the backend to debug.

The simple backend removes all OAuth complexity and just shows us the raw data. Once we see that, fixing the format will be trivial.

## Estimated Time to Resolution

- Build & deploy: ~5 minutes (in progress)
- Test iOS app: ~1 minute
- Check logs: ~1 minute
- Identify issue: ~2 minutes
- Fix code: ~10 minutes
- Final test: ~5 minutes

**Total: ~25 minutes from now**

## What If It Still Fails?

If authentication still fails with the simple backend (which accepts ANYTHING), then the issue is:
- Network connectivity
- iOS app not reaching the backend at all
- URL configuration wrong
- CORS issues

But I'm 95% confident this will work because:
- Backend health endpoint works ‚úÖ
- We can curl the backend ‚úÖ
- iOS app shows it's trying to auth ‚úÖ
- Problem is just data format mismatch

## Current Status

‚è≥ Building container image...
‚è≥ Will deploy once build completes...
‚è≥ Then you can test immediately!

I'll let you know once it's deployed and ready to test.
