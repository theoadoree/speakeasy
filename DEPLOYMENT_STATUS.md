# Deployment Status - October 30, 2025

## Critical Fix Applied

### Issue Identified
The App.js was in **DEBUG/TEST MODE** with the full application commented out. This is why authentication and all features were not working - the app was only showing a test screen saying "SpeakEasy TEST".

### Fix Applied
✅ Restored full application in App.js (removed test mode code)
✅ Fixed web-server configuration to serve static files correctly
✅ Rebuilt and redeployed web application
