# Logo Replacement Instructions

## Your New Logo

The new SpeakEasy logo (teacher avatar with AI branding) should be placed at:

```
assets/logo.png
```

## Steps to Add Your Logo:

1. Save your logo image as `logo.png` (the one with the teacher character, neural network circles, and "SpeakEasy AI-Powered Language Teacher" text)

2. Replace the existing file at:
   ```
   /Users/scott/dev/speakeasy/assets/logo.png
   ```

3. The logo should be:
   - **Format**: PNG with transparent background
   - **Recommended size**: 800x800 pixels or larger
   - **Content**: The full logo including the teacher avatar, branding text, and tagline

## The Logo Is Already Integrated!

The sign-in screen (`src/screens/NewAuthScreen.js`) has been updated to:
- Display a large, prominent logo (280x280 points)
- Remove redundant text branding (since your logo includes it)
- Center the logo above the sign-in buttons
- Maintain proper spacing

## Current Sign-In Screen Layout:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│     [Large Logo Image]      │
│  (Teacher with branding)    │
│                             │
│    ▶ Sign in with Apple     │
│                             │
│    ▶ Continue with Google   │
│                             │
│    Terms & Privacy Policy   │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## What Was Fixed:

✅ **Apple Sign In** - Backend now returns correct response format
✅ **Google Sign In** - Backend now returns correct response format
✅ **No Guest Option** - Removed (only social sign-in available)
✅ **Logo Prominence** - Large centered logo above sign-in options
✅ **Clean Layout** - No redundant text since logo includes branding

## Backend Changes Deployed:

The authentication endpoints now return the correct format:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    token: "session_token",
    user: {
      id: "...",
      name: "...",
      email: "...",
      provider: "google|apple"
    }
  }
}
```

This matches what the mobile app expects, so sign-in will now work properly!
