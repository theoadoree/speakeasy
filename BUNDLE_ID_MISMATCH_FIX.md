# Bundle ID Mismatch - Root Cause Found!

## The Problem

Apple Developer logs show the actual Bundle ID being used is:
```
com.speakeasy.ios.SpeakEasy
```

But we've been configuring Google OAuth with:
```
org.name.SpeakEasy
```

**This is why authentication fails!**

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Update Google OAuth Client (Recommended)

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console - Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=modular-analog-476221-h8)

2. Find OAuth 2.0 Client ID: `823510409781-aqd90aoj080374pnfjultufdkk027qsp`

3. Edit it and set:
   - Application type: **iOS**
   - Bundle ID: **`com.speakeasy.ios.SpeakEasy`** (NOT org.name.SpeakEasy)

4. Save

5. Test the app again

### Option 2: Update Xcode Project (Alternative)

If you want to keep `org.name.SpeakEasy`:

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select the SpeakEasy target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
4. Manually set Bundle Identifier to: `org.name.SpeakEasy`
5. Disable "Automatically manage signing"
6. Update Google OAuth client to use `org.name.SpeakEasy`

## Why This Happened

Xcode is automatically managing the bundle ID and it's using `com.speakeasy.ios.SpeakEasy` which is registered with your Apple Developer account (Team ID: E7B9UE64SF).

The project file says `org.name.SpeakEasy` but when you build/run, Xcode is changing it to `com.speakeasy.ios.SpeakEasy`.

## Verification

After fixing the Google OAuth client, you should see:
- ✅ Google Sign In popup appears
- ✅ Can select Google account
- ✅ App successfully authenticates
- ✅ Navigates to home screen

The backend is already configured correctly - it just needs Google OAuth to allow `com.speakeasy.ios.SpeakEasy`.
